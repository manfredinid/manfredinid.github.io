I’m Denise, a MSc in Economic Development by [Universidade Federal do Paraná](http://www.prppg.ufpr.br/site/ppgde/) and Ph.D. candidate at [Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina](http://ppgeco.ufsc.br). My research interest lies in applied macroeconomics, with a particular interest in economic growth and firm dynamics.

I'm currently living in Wellington-NZ where I am a visiting scholar at the Wellington School of Business and Government, [Victoria University of Wellington](https://www.wgtn.ac.nz/sef).
